# Webpack Basic Example

Minimal example showing how Webpack bundles multiple ES modules into a single file.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates `dist/main.js` - a bundled version of your source files.

## View

Open `index.html` in a browser and check the console to see the result.
